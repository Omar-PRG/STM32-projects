# Temperature-sensor
In the beginning, we had a program that contains all the STM32 basic sensors (Temperature,pressure,humidity,GYRO). In this project, we removed all the functions related to other sensors in order to make on program that is only related to the temperature one. This simplification shows that we fully understood the main program so that we are able now to write a program for each sensor independently.
